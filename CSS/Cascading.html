    <!--CSS:
        CSS stands for cascading style sheets.
        It constis of properties and values
        ex:h1
        CSS works on top of HTML.
        <h1>
        There are 3 ways of CSS.
        1)Inline CSS:
        2)Internal CSS:
        3)External CSS:

        Inline CSS is where we write with in the HTML elements itself,
        with style attribute.

        <h1 style="background-color:blue">HI</h1>
        here background-color is called a property
        and blue is the value.
        we can have so many properties on css and muliple properties :

        Internal CSS:
        With in the head section we need write style attribute and what all the
        common code is the we can use with the HTML element.
        and in order to over come the inline css where we write multiple 
        propeties for a single html element we can use Internal CSS.

        Internal CSS is once again 
        segerated into 3 ways.
        1)Element:By using html element we are displaying the css 
        so for which html element we want we write that particular html 
        element over there.

        2)ID : in case if we use id we need to use (#) to give the name of the html
        element

        3)Class is used to represent Internal css by using (.) with the
        html element.
